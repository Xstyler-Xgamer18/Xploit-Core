### Hacking
As mentioned, this tool serves many purposes. But we haven’t really talked about the hacking part yet—mainly because we just didn’t. Joking aside:

YES, this is a hacking tool.
BUT, it's not designed to be used as one. The main goal is to provide a fun way for people to experience cybersecurity, especially those who aren’t familiar with hacking or security concepts.

In the first full release, the tool includes working hacking features like brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks. However, as mentioned a few times already, these tools are not intended to harm anyone. They are meant to help you test your password strength in a safe and educational way.
